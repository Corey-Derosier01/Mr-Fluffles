    <div class="Paragraph">I am Mr. Fluffle i have bright blue eyes and a very fluffy tail.
        I like to ignore my owner and prance around the house proudly ignoring him. I meow at him until he feeds me
        food. sometimes he feeds me right away, but when he does not I like to annoyingly meow until he does. I
        don't have many friends but my owner can sometimes be my friend because I need him for things i cannot do
        for myself. He would even clean my bathroom when its very dirty, I would watch and laugh as he makes faces
        of disgust. Thats my favorite part of the week because i like to watch him suffer.
